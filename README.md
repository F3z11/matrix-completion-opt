# Matrix Completion via Optimization

A comprehensive implementation and comparison of **optimization algorithms for low-rank matrix completion**, developed as part of the *Optimization for Data Science* course project.

## 🧠 Overview

**Matrix completion** seeks to recover missing entries from a partially observed matrix by leveraging its **low-rank structure**.  
This problem is fundamental in:
- 🎬 **Recommender systems** (e.g., Netflix ratings)
- 🖼️ **Image inpainting**
- 📡 **Sensor network data recovery**

This project focuses on _Recommender systems_ and benchmarks several optimization approaches to understand their performance across different data types and levels of sparsity.

## ⚙️ Implemented Methods

- **Frank-Wolfe (FW)**
- **Pairwise Frank-Wolfe (PFW)**
- **Projected Gradient (PG)**

## 📊 What We Did

- Implemented and compared algorithms under a unified experimental framework  
- Evaluated performance on **real datasets**  
- Analyzed **convergence behavior**, **computational cost**, and **accuracy**  
- Produced visualizations of reconstruction accuracy and convergence behavior
